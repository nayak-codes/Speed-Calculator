🔷 ABSTRACT (ENGLISH)

Live Speed Calculator Web and Mobile Application is a smart location-based system designed to calculate and display the real-time speed of a user while traveling in any vehicle such as a car, bus, train, or flight. The application uses GPS-based geolocation data to continuously track the user’s movement and calculates speed using distance and time parameters.

Unlike existing speedometer applications, this system focuses on intelligent features such as automatic vehicle detection, journey start and stop tracking, route visualization on maps, and detailed journey summaries including average speed, maximum speed, total distance, and travel time. The application is designed specifically for Indian transportation conditions, supporting low network availability and providing accurate speed estimation.

The project is first implemented as a web application using modern web technologies and later extended into a mobile application. This system helps users monitor their travel speed, analyze journey patterns, and share travel summaries, making it useful for daily commuters, travelers, and students while also serving as a strong real-world learning project in full stack development.
